This has resulted in heavy projects that are difficult to manage and scale. This book will explain a new way to write web applications by treating the front-end as if it were a third-party (such as a mobile client). This book, written by a practicing MEAN developer, will take a holistic approach to using the MEAN JavaScript platform for creating modern web applications and lay out how to use the MEAN (Mongo, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) set of tools to create a web application, from installation and setup of the tools to debugging and deploying your app. After an introduction to how web development is changing and the advantages of using the MEAN stack, the author jumps into an introduction to each tool and then dives into using the complete JavaScript-based application stack to build, test, and deploy apps.",

        "description": "Modern websites use a variety of animated effects not only to improve usability but also to delight and surprise users. Some of these effects require complex scripting or programming skills, but many are within the grasp of designers who are already familiar with CSS and HTML. CSS Animations and Transitions for the Modern Web shows designers how to add movement to web pages over time using CSS3 style definitions. Author Steven Bradley begins as simply as possible and uses elementary skills as the basis for more advanced techniques. Conceptual explanation is combined with specific examples to give designers a solid foundation in the art of creating dynamic and appealing websites. Steven’s examples are posted at peachpit.com so readers can see the animations in action and download the code files for further study. Instructions for access are in the “Getting Started” section. With CSS Animations and Transitions for the Modern Web, you’ll learn how to make your websites more vibrant and compelling with user interfaces that are functional, reliable, and usable, as well as beautiful. Up-to-date information on current browser support for CSS animations and transitions An introduction to manipulating web page objects in both 2D and 3D space Techniques for creating smooth transitions between object states An overview of Disney’s principles for creating realistic animation and how they apply to web page designs",

Especially useful for frontend developers, this revision includes specific chapters on React and VueJS, as well as an updated one on Angular. To help you get the most of your new skills, each chapter also has a \"further reading\" section. This book will serve as an introduction to both new and well established libraries and frameworks, such as Angular, VueJS, React, Grunt, Yeoman, RequireJS, Browserify, Knockout, Kraken, Async.js, Underscore, and Lodash. It also covers utilities that have gained popular traction and support from seasoned developers and tools applicable to the entire development stack, both client- and server-side. While no single book can possibly cover every JavaScript library of value, JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Development focuses on incredibly useful libraries and frameworks that production software uses. You will be treated to detailed analyses and sample code for tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal scaling, and interacting with disparate data stores. What You'll Learn Work with a variety of JavaScript frameworks, such as Angular, Vue, React, RequireJS, Knockout, and more Choose the right framework for different types of projects Employ the appropriate libraries and tools in your projects Discover useful JavaScript development tools such as Grunt, Yeoman, Lodash, etc. Who This Book Is For Web developers of all levels of ability; particularly relevant for front-end developers, server-side coders, and developers interested in learning JavaScript.",
